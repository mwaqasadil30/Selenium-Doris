Run tests by substring matching:

Let we have three methods:

1.def test_login():
2.test_datasource_login():
3.def test_entity():

Here to run all the tests having login in its functiona name we have to run 


py.test -k login -v

it will execute below methods

def test_login():
test_datasource_login():

and Not below:
 
def test_entity():

****************************

Run tests by markers:
Below command is used to run function whose marker is "set1", it will only execute 1st and 3rd function and it will ignore 2nd function.
py.test -m set1.

@pytest.mark.set1
def test_login():

def test_datasource_login():

@pytest.mark.set1
def test_entity():



*******************************************
Pytest fixtures:
Fixtures are used when we want to run some code before every test method. So instead of repeating the same code in every test we define fixtures.

@pytest.fixture
def test_login():

def test_datasource_login():

def test_entity():

below command will execute test_lgin function before both fucntions every time.
 py.test test_basic_fixture
